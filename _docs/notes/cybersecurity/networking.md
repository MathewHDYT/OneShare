## Networking

### Meaning:

`Networks` are simply things that are connected. They can be found in all walks of like:

- A city's public transportation system
- Infrastructure such as the national power grid for electricity
- Meeting and greeting your neighbors
- Postal system for sending letters and parcels

In computing, however, networking is the same idea, just dispersed to technological devices and can mean anything from connecting 2 devices to up to billions of devices.

### Internet: 

The **internet** is one giant **network** that consists of may, many small **networks** within itself.

The first iteration of the internet was within the `ARPANET` project in the late 1960s.
It was funded by the United States Defense Department and was the first documented network in action.

However, it wasn't until 1989 when the internet as we know it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW).

The **internet** is made up of many small **networks** all joined together.
These small **networks** are called private **networks**, where **network** connecting these small **networks** are called public **networks**, or the **internet**.

So **networks** can be one of these two types:
- Private **network**
- Public **network**

Devices additionally use a set of labels to identify themselves on a **network**.

### Identifying Devices:

To communicate and maintain order, devices must be both identifying and identifiable on a network.
There are two ways to ensure devices on a network are identified:
- **`IP` Address**, similar to a name can be changed
- **Media Access Control (MAC) Address**, similar to a fingerprint or serial number and cannot be changed

### IP Address:

Can be used as a way of identifying a host on a **network** for a period of time, where that **`IP` address** can then be associated with another device without the **`IP` address** changing.

It consists of a set of numbers that are divided into four **octets**, where each octet consists of a number from 0 to 255.
The address can change from device to device but cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network.

As recalled earlier devices can be on both a private and public **network**.
Depending on where they are will determine what type of **`IP` address** they have, which is also either public or private.

**DEVICE NAME** | **IP ADDRESS** | **IP ADDRESS TYPE** |
--------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
DESKTOP-KJE57FD | 192.168.1.77 | Private |
DESKTOP-KJE57FD | 86.157.52.21 | Public |
CMNatic-PC | 192.168.1.74 | Private |
CMNatic-PC | 86.157.52.21 | Public |

In this case both devices will be able to use their private **`IP` address** to communicate with each other.
However, any data sent to the **internet** from either device will be identified by the same public **`IP` address**, which is provided by your `Internet Service Provider` (`ISP`).

`IPv4` which we discussed above uses a numbering system of 2^32 **`IP` address** (4.29 billion).
Sadly this is not enough anymore which is the reason a new iteration of Internet Protocol addressing scheme called `IPv6` was created.
It supports up to 2^128 **`IP` address** (340 trillion) and is even more efficient due to new methodologies.

**IPv6**: 2a00:22c4:a531:c500:425f:cce6:c36b:f64d
**IPv4**: 86.157.52.51

### MAC Address:

Devices on a **network** all have a physical **network** interface, which is a microchip board found on the devices' motherboard.
This **network** interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a `MAC` (`Media Access Control`) address.

It is a twelve-character hexadecimal number split into pairs of two and separated by a colon.
The first six characters represent the company that made the network interface, and the last six are a unique number.

### Spoofing:

A `MAC` address can be faked in a process know as spoofing. It occurs when a networked device pretends to identify as another using its `MAC` address.
When this occurs, system that assume that devices talking on a **network** are trustworthy can often break.

Often places such as caf√©s, coffee shops, and hotels alike often use `MAC` address control when using their `"Guest"` or `"Public"` Wi-Fi.

### Ping (ICMP):

**Ping** uses `ICMP` (`Internet Control Message Protocol`) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices.
For example if the connection exists or is reliable.

The time taken for `ICMP` packets travelling between devices is measured by **ping**.
This is done using the `ICMP` echo packet and then the `ICMP` echo reply from the target device.

**Pings** can be performed against devices on a network.
The syntax to do a simple ping is `ping` **`IP` address** or website URL.
