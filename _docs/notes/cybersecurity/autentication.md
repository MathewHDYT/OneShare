## Authentication

### Meaning:

**Authentication** is the process of verifying a users identity and establishing that they are who they say they are.

### Example:

1. A known set of credentials to the server and user such as a password and username
2. Token authentication (these are unique pieces of encrypted text)
3. Biometric authentication (fingerprints, retina data, etc.)

### Authentication vs. Authorization: 

**Authentication** is often used interchangeably with **authorization**, but is very different. **Authorization** is a term for the rules defining what an authenticated user can and cannot access.

**Authentication** is used when there is a necessity to know who is accessing pieces of data or information to create accountability – protecting the `Confidentiality` element of the `CIA` (**Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability** (`CIA`) is the opposite of **Disclosure**, **Alternation**, and **Destruction** (`DAD`)) triad.
